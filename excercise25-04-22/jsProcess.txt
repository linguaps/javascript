RETIREMENT CALCULATOR

Input: Digits

Output: Strings, digits

Constraints: -Input can be only numbers.	
-The age, the user wants to retire may not necessarily mean that she/he is qualified to retire at that time
-Only years with 4 digits (e.g. 2020, 2090 etc.) and numbers with 2/3 digits referring to age (45, 102 etc.) will be used.

Processes: - Get the user's inputs
- define them
- write a function to do the math and display the output
	-At first, yearDif= futureAge - currentAge
	-Then, futureYear= currentYear + yearDif
	-Display "You have ${yearDif} years left until you can retire.
	It's 2022, so you can retire in ${futureYear}."
